# Persian mehrsa
A very basic rogerian psychotherapist chatbot in Persian

## About mehrsa
This early natural language processing program had been written in the mid-1960s at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. It supposedly had been created to demonstrate how superficial human to computer communications was at that time. But, when it was put on personal computers, humans found it quite engaging.

### WHAT DOES mehrsa DO?
Using "pattern matching" and substitution methodology, the program gives canned responses that made early users feel they were talking to someone who understood their input. The program was limited by the scripts that were in the program. (mehrsa was originally written in MAD-Slip.) Many variations on the original scripts were made as amateur coders played around with the fairly simple code.

Perhaps the most well known variation was called DOCTOR. This was made to respond like a Rogerian psychotherapist. In this instance, the therapist "reflects" on questions by turning the questions back at the patient.

mehrsa was one of the first chatterbots (later clipped to chatbot). It was also an early test case for the Turing Test, a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. By today's standards mehrsa fails very quickly if you ask it a few complex questions.

## About Persian mehrsa
This project is a persian clone of the main mehrsa. The main idea behind it was to make a simple persian chatterbot and evaluate it.
